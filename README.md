# Life-Expectancy-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning

This project focuses on predicting the life expectancy of individuals across countries using machine learning models. A real-world dataset containing socio-economic and health-related indicators (such as GDP, schooling, alcohol consumption, immunization rates, etc.) was used to train the models.

After performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover key insights and correlations, the data was cleaned, normalized, and preprocessed using techniques like encoding and scaling. Several regression models were trained and evaluated to find the best-performing one.
